                    I am a sophomore and a part of the class of 2028. My name is Jonah.</p>

                    Learning is a big part of who I am, as I have mastered none of my 
                    current hobbies. I am learning guitar (along with some other instruments)
                    and I play in a band called <em>Carrey Powers</em>. We create and cover rock music 
                    and have a lot of fun playing and learning together. It is 
                    also really great "team building" as we have to agree on everything we do.

                    <em>"A band is like a marriage, and if you're in a marriage with someone, and you

                    I am extremely interested in studying computer science, and specifically AI. I find it to be 
                    extremely interesting and I believe that AI is the future. It is not something that should scare people 
                    and it certainly is not something that people should worry about. It makes us more efficient as a society, 
                    and if it takes jobs from people, those people will adapt. It will not be an easy or quick change 
                    for us, but it will be definite and sure.

                    I also play and am learning rugby. It is exciting to feel improvements after each practice and game with my team. 
                    I am not even close to the best on the team, however it is extremely fun to learn and to build 
                    connections with my teammates.

                                I currently work in the garden center department of Pemberton
                                Farms. That means I am in the <em>outside</em> portion of the store.
                                right now for Christmas time, I am helping to sell trees to families.
                                Working at Pemberton Farms means working with a team as one. It means
                                a lot of socializing as well as team building.

                                In addition to talking to families, I also help the families pick out 
                                this years Christmas tree for their house. I give recommendations based on what
                                they expressed they want for their home, and I explain the difference between the 
                                two kinds of trees we sell. Once they pick out their tree, I carry to the Christmas
                                tree baler (the net chute) to be netted up and loaded on the car. Then I carry it to
                                the customer's car and find a new family to help.

                                        I started playing Rugby freshman year thanks to one of my best friends.
                                        It is extremely fun and I really enjoy the game. I play second row as a forward (lock)
                                        (number 4/5).

                                        I played soccer for about 9 years from 3-12. Quite frankly I hate the game. I hate watching
                                    and playing it. I was my team's goalie.

                                        I played flag football for about 8 years from 5-13. Football is amazing, it's fun to watch, 
                                        and fun to play. I was usually my team's center.

            <p>I’m a motivated and detail-oriented individual with a passion for learning, problem-solving, 
                and bringing ideas to life through technology and design. I enjoy taking on challenges that 
                push me to understand how things work beneath the surface, whether that’s through coding, creating 
                digital projects, or improving systems I interact with. Curiosity drives a lot of what I do, and I 
                always look for opportunities to grow and refine my skills.</p>

            <p>I’m particularly drawn to projects that combine creativity with logic. Throughout my experience, 
                I’ve enjoyed building solutions that are both functional and visually appealing, and I take pride
                 in writing clean, organized code. When working on a project, I focus heavily on structure, clarity, 
                 and intention—making sure everything serves a purpose and contributes to the bigger picture. 
                 Collaboration is also important to me, and I value working alongside others who are passionate about their craft.</p>

            <p>Outside of technical work, I strive to maintain a balance between personal interests and 
                professional goals. I enjoy exploring new hobbies, learning new tools, and staying active 
                in environments that challenge me to adapt and improve. Whether I’m experimenting with a new 
                coding technique, working on a creative idea, or learning something completely outside my comfort
                 zone, I’m always aiming to broaden my perspective and keep progressing in a meaningful direction.</p>
