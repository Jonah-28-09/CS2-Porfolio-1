                    I am a sophomore and a part of the class of 2028. My name is Jonah.</p>

                <p class="top_space">
                    Learning is a big part of who I am, as I have mastered none of my 
                    current hobbies. I am learning guitar (along with some other instruments)
                    and I play in a band called <em>Carrey Powers</em>. We create and cover rock music 
                    and have a lot of fun playing and learning together. It is 
                    also really great "team building" as we have to agree on everything we do.
                </p>

                    <em>"A band is like a marriage, and if you're in a marriage with someone, and you 
                    lose yourself in that marriage, the relationship is over, really,"</em> <strong>- Richie Sombora</strong>

                <p class="top_space_large">
                    I am extremely interested in studying computer science, and specifically AI. I find it to be 
                    extremely interesting and I believe that AI is the future. It is not something that should scare people 
                    and it certainly is not something that people should worry about. It makes us more efficient as a society, 
                    and if it takes jobs from people, those people will adapt. It will not be an easy or quick change 
                    for us, but it will be definite and sure.

                    I also play and am learning rugby. It is exciting to feel improvements after each practice and game with my team. 
                    I am not even close to the best on the team, however it is extremely fun to learn and to build 
                    connections with my teammates.

            <p>I’m a motivated and detail-oriented individual with a passion for learning, problem-solving, 
                and bringing ideas to life through technology and design. I enjoy taking on challenges that 
                push me to understand how things work beneath the surface, whether that’s through coding, creating 
                digital projects, or improving systems I interact with. Curiosity drives a lot of what I do, and I 
                always look for opportunities to grow and refine my skills.</p>

            <p>I’m particularly drawn to projects that combine creativity with logic. Throughout my experience, 
                I’ve enjoyed building solutions that are both functional and visually appealing, and I take pride
                 in writing clean, organized code. When working on a project, I focus heavily on structure, clarity, 
                 and intention—making sure everything serves a purpose and contributes to the bigger picture. 
                 Collaboration is also important to me, and I value working alongside others who are passionate about their craft.</p>

            <p>Outside of technical work, I strive to maintain a balance between personal interests and 
                professional goals. I enjoy exploring new hobbies, learning new tools, and staying active 
                in environments that challenge me to adapt and improve. Whether I’m experimenting with a new 
                coding technique, working on a creative idea, or learning something completely outside my comfort
                 zone, I’m always aiming to broaden my perspective and keep progressing in a meaningful direction.</p>
